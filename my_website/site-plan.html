        The development of fission nuclear reactors can be traced back to 1930s. Shortly after neutron was discovered by James Chadwick in 1932, it was observed that nuclear reaction could prompted by neutrons. In 1939, it was observed that the nuclear chain reaction can be maintained by the neutrons released during the nuclear reaction of Uranium. During the nuclear chain reaction, a Uranium nucleus is collided by a neutron. After the impact, the Uranium nucleus split into several energized lighter and one to three energized neutrons. The kinetic energy of the reaction products convert to the thermal energy and the neutrons will impact other Uranium atoms and continue the reactions. Tremendous amount of heat energy is then released from the nuclear reaction. The nuclear chain reaction was first proposed to be used for development of the next generation massive bombs. And the research later results in the atomic bomb that changed the human history. In the 1940S, scientists and engineers began to know more about how to control the nuclear reaction and started to use it as a energy source. Unlike atomic bomb that release tremendous energy in a fracture of a second, nuclear reactors release thermal energy stably and gradually for months or even years.

      <h3>Light Water Reactor</h3>
      <p>
        For the early development of nuclear fission reactors, the goal is to create a power source that can support battleships or submarines for months without any fuel supply. For the convenience of naval application, light water was chosen to be the coolant of the nuclear reactor system. Light water can be easily extracted from seawater, and it has a relatively high specific heat capacity, compared to liquid metals. The practice of using light water was later adopted for the development of civilian commercial reactors. However, water also has its drawbacks when being used as the coolant in the nuclear system. First, water requires a pressurized operating environment. As we know, water boils at 100 Celsius changes its phase from liquid to vapor. For a nuclear reactor system, higher operation temperature results in high energy production efficiency. To avoid the water from transforming to vapor at 400 Celsius. The pressure inside the nuclear reactor must be maintained at 30 ATM, which is equal to 30 times of the standard atmosphere. The high operating pressure of light water increase the risks. Whenever this is an opening rupture, the reactor system will then act like a balloon. A well designed pressure vessel must be installed outside the reactor system. The second drawback of light water is because it is too common and important in our ecosystem. If the light water escapes from the nuclear system by accident, the radioactive water can get absorbed and pollute the environments. Once the land is polluted radioactively, it will take several hundred years for the land to be inhabitant again. The genetics of living creatures in the area will be damaged and passed on to their descendants.

      <h3>Gen 4 Reactor-Molten Salt Reactor</h3>
      <p>
        Different from the conventional fission reactors, molten salt reactors use lithium based molten salt as it reactor coolant. Lithium has a very high melting point at over 500 Celsius. Molten salt reactors operate at 760 Celsius with the pressure at 1 ATM. This significantly improve the efficiency of the energy production process and a pressure vessel is no longer needed for the nuclear power plant. This high melting point of molten salt also adds a safety feature for the nuclear system. Whenever the molten salt leaves the reactor, the salt will be immediately cooled down by the environment and radioactive contaminants will be trapped in the solid salt.
