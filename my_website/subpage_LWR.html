    <h1 id="subpage-title">Light Water Reactor</h1>
    <p> For the early development of nuclear fission reactors, the goal is to create a power source that can support battleships or submarines for months without any fuel supply. For the convenience of naval application, light water was chosen to be the coolant of the nuclear reactor system. Light water can be easily extracted from seawater, and it has a relatively high specific heat capacity, compared to liquid metals. The practice of using light water was later adopted for the development of civilian commercial reactors. However, water also has its drawbacks when being used as the coolant in the nuclear system. First, water requires a pressurized operating environment. As we know, water boils at 100 Celsius changes its phase from liquid to vapor. For a nuclear reactor system, higher operation temperature results in high energy production efficiency. To avoid the water from transforming to vapor at 400 Celsius. The pressure inside the nuclear reactor must be maintained at 30 ATM, which is equal to 30 times of the standard atmosphere. The high operating pressure of light water increase the risks. Whenever this is an opening rupture, the reactor system will then act like a balloon. A well designed pressure vessel must be installed outside the reactor system. The second drawback of light water is because it is too common and important in our ecosystem. If the light water escapes from the nuclear system by accident, the radioactive water can get absorbed and pollute the environments. Once the land is polluted radioactively, it will take several hundred years for the land to be inhabitant again. The genetics of living creatures in the area will be damaged and passed on to their descendants.</p>
