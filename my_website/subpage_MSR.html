            <p>Different from the conventional fission reactors, molten salt reactors use lithium based molten salt as it reactor coolant. Lithium has a very high melting point at over 500 Celsius. Molten salt reactors operate at 760 Celsius with the pressure at 1 ATM. This significantly improve the efficiency of the energy production process and a pressure vessel is no longer needed for the nuclear power plant. This high melting point of molten salt also adds a safety feature for the nuclear system. Whenever the molten salt leaves the reactor, the salt will be immediately cooled down by the environment and radioactive contaminants will be trapped in the solid salt.</p>

            <h1 class="subpage-title">Reactor Cycle of Molten Salt Reactor</h1>
            <p>In the system of a molten salt reactor, there are three coolant systems: a primary coolant loop, a secondary loop, and a steam loop. The primary coolant loop is fill with molten salt that contains the radioactive fuel at 1 atm. The molten salt flows through the reactor core where the nuclear reaction occurs. The heated salt will flow out of the core and the generated heat is then transferred to the secondary salt loop through a heat exchanger. The secondary loop is filled with non-radioative motlen salt at 1 atm. The purpose of the secondary loop is to heat up the water steam in the steam loop. The steam will absorb the heat and expand. The expansion of water steam will push the turbine of the gnrstor and produce electricity. Since the molten salt loops are operating at standard atmosphere. No pressure vessel are required to protect the radioactive fuel from leaking. Once the radioactive salt escape into the environment from the primary loop. The salt will turn solid immediately due to the cold surrounding temperature. This decrease the risk of environmental pollution due to nuclear accidents.</p>
