    Hello everyone! My name is WaiLam Chan from Hong Kong. I have been being in the U.S for almost 10 years. Six years ago, I graduated with a B.S. in mechanical engineering from BYUI and now I am doing my PhD in mechanical engineering at the University of Kentucky. I really love the atmosphere in Rexburg. The people are super nice in that little town and it is also very close to a lot of beautiful spots in the area, such as Yellow Stone and Mesa Falls. One reason I am taking this class now is because I want to learn some knowledge about creating website and this class will definitely equip me with some fundametal knowledge that is necesary for other advanced web design courses. Altough I have some coding experience already but web development is totally new for me. Hopefully we can help each other out during the semester.

    During my free time I like to go hiking. There are a lot of hiking trails near Lexington Kentucky. One of my favorite places is the natural bridge on the east Kentucky. The natrual bridge is only 45 minutes east of Lexington. And the hike is only an hour long so it is very friendly for families to spend a Saturday afternoon there.
